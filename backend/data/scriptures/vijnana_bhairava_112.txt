# Vijnana Bhairava Tantra - 112 Meditation Techniques
Source: Ancient Tantric Scripture - Dialogue between Shiva and Shakti

## Introduction

The Vijnana Bhairava Tantra is a key text of Kashmir Shaivism, containing 112 dharanas (meditation techniques) revealed by Lord Shiva to Devi Shakti. Each technique is a doorway to experiencing the supreme consciousness (Bhairava).

Devi asks: "O Shiva, what is your reality? What is this wonder-filled universe? What constitutes the seed of the universe? Who is at the center of the wheel of the universe? What is this life beyond form pervading all forms? How may we enter into it fully?"

Shiva responds with 112 methods...

## Breath-Based Techniques (1-17)

### Technique 1: Breath Awareness at Two Points
"Radiant One, this experience may dawn between two breaths. After breath comes in and just before turning up to go out - the beneficence."

Practice: Watch the breath entering. At the moment it turns to go out, there is a tiny gap. Rest awareness in that gap. The same at the outer turn. These junction points are doorways to the eternal present.

### Technique 2: Following the Breath
"As breath turns from down to up, and again as breath curves from up to down - through both these turns, realize."

Practice: Follow the breath continuously through its entire journey - entering, turning inside, leaving, turning outside. The turning points are where consciousness touches its source.

### Technique 3: Fusion of Breaths
"Or, whenever in-breath and out-breath fuse, at this instant touch the energy-less, energy-filled center."

Practice: When inhalation and exhalation meet and merge, there is a moment of stillness. Enter deeply into that fusion point. Here, the energy rests in its source.

### Technique 4: Breath Retention
"Or, when breath is all out and stopped of itself, or all in and stopped - in such universal pause, one's small self vanishes."

Practice: After full exhalation, when breath naturally stops (external kumbhaka), or after full inhalation when it naturally pauses (internal kumbhaka) - in that stillness, the ego-self dissolves.

### Technique 5: Visualization in the Subtle Body
"Consider your essence as light rays rising from center to center up the vertebrae, and so rises livingness in you."

Practice: Visualize luminous energy rising through the spinal column, from the base (Muladhara) through each chakra to the crown (Sahasrara). Feel life itself ascending.

### Technique 6: Lightning-Like Awareness
"Or in the spaces between, feel this as lightning."

Practice: Between each chakra, experience sudden flashes of awareness, like lightning illuminating dark space. These gaps between centers are doorways.

### Technique 7: The Descending Path
"Or, through senses, moving through chakras, feel the fine qualities of creativity permeating from the crown of the head."

Practice: Reverse the previous technique. Feel consciousness descending from the crown through each center, like divine nectar flowing down, infusing each chakra with awareness.

### Technique 8: Divine Sound in the Heart
"Intone a sound, as AUM, slowly. As sound enters soundfulness, so do you."

Practice: Chant AUM slowly, listening to the vibration. Follow the sound as it fades into silence. Enter that silence fully. The silence after the sound is your true nature.

### Technique 9: Closing the Ears
"With mouth slightly open, keep mind in the middle of the tongue. Or, as breath comes silently in, feel the sound HH."

Practice: Seal the ears with thumbs (Shanmukhi Mudra), close eyes, and listen to the inner sounds. Eventually, a subtle humming will be heard - the nada. Follow it to its source.

### Technique 10: The Soundless Sound
"Closing the ears, contract the lower opening. Then, entering the sound which is not struck, reach the Brahman, the Eternal."

Practice: With ears closed and root lock (Mula Bandha) engaged, listen for the unstruck sound (Anahata Nada). This inner sound exists without cause - it is the vibration of consciousness itself.

### Technique 11: Listening to Stringed Instruments
"While listening to stringed instruments, hear their composite central sound; thus omnipresence."

Practice: When listening to music, especially veena or tanpura, listen to the overall resonance rather than individual notes. In that unified sound, the background silence becomes apparent.

### Technique 12: Chanting Vowels
"Intoning a sound audibly, then less and less audibly, as feeling deepens into this silent harmony, one becomes that silence."

Practice: Chant any vowel sound (A, U, M, etc.) loudly, then gradually softer and softer until only mental repetition remains, then even that dissolves into pure silence. Rest there.

### Technique 13: The Expanse of Sound
"At the edges of sound - any sound - be present. Thus the reality of the omnipresent."

Practice: Whether hearing music, speech, or random noise, attend to where the sound fades into silence at its edges. In those edges is the infinite.

### Technique 14: Beginning and End of Sounds
"At the start of sound, of any letter, be aware. In this initial awakening, awareness of emptiness."

Practice: When about to speak any letter, be present at the very beginning - before the sound emerges but after the intention forms. That pregnant moment is full of presence.

### Technique 15: Musical Scale Ascent
"In a sound with all the letters, reach the feeling of the letters' source, one by one. From this sublime feeling comes liberation."

Practice: Intone sounds through the scale, from lowest to highest. With each ascending note, feel the energy rising in the body. At the highest note, transcend into the formless.

### Technique 16: Simple Sound Practice
"Bathing in the center of sound, as in the continuous sound of a waterfall, or by putting the fingers in the ears, hear the sound of sounds."

Practice: Use either external continuous sound (waterfall, fan, rain) or close the ears and listen to inner sounds. In continuous sound, the mind eventually perceives the primordial vibration.

### Technique 17: AUM Meditation
"Intoning the AUM, O energy-filled one, become all sound, then nothing. Only then can the Supreme Self be realized."

Practice: Become the sound AUM completely - let it fill all consciousness. When the sound ends and you become nothing, what remains is the Supreme Self.

## Visualization Techniques (18-44)

### Technique 18: Imagining Dissolution
"Imagine the five elements, one by one, being dissolved into subtler elements until nothing remains."

Practice: Visualize earth dissolving into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into space, space into consciousness. When all dissolves, what remains is pure awareness.

### Technique 19: The Shakti as Dissolving Fire
"Imagine the Shakti fire ascending from the big toe, burning the body completely, until only ash remains. Then even the ash is dissolved."

Practice: Visualize divine fire rising from the feet, consuming the body progressively - flesh, blood, bones - until only ash remains. Then that ash dissolves into space. What witnesses this?

### Technique 20: World as Burning
"Meditate on the world as burning - the elements, the space, everything consumed by fire. As all becomes formless, peace descends."

Practice: See the entire universe being consumed by cosmic fire - all objects, beings, planets dissolving. When nothing remains, the fire has no fuel and also disappears. Rest in what remains.

### Technique 21: Subtle Element Meditation
"Meditating on the subtle elements - from tanmatra to tanmatra - finally the mind dissolves into the supreme."

Practice: Contemplate progressively subtler aspects of experience - from gross objects to sensations to their subtle qualities to pure energy to consciousness. Follow the subtle back to its source.

### Technique 22: Blue Light at Heart
"Meditate on the heart lotus, with twelve petals, containing a blue light within. From this, the divine presence."

Practice: Visualize a lotus flower at the heart center. In its center, see a brilliant blue light (or tiny blue flame). Rest attention there. The blue light is the presence of the Divine.

### Technique 23: Inner Space of the Heart
"Place the mind in the interior of the heart and think of nothing else. Thus the supreme reality is reached."

Practice: Direct attention to the inner space of the heart (not the physical heart, but the spiritual heart center - slightly right of center). Keep mind there, empty of thoughts.

### Technique 24: Full Heart Meditation
"Blessed one, as your senses are absorbed in the heart, reach the center of the lotus within."

Practice: Withdraw all senses inward to the heart center. Like rivers flowing to the ocean, let seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling all dissolve into the heart-space.

### Technique 25: Mind in the Middle of the Body
"Concentrate on a fire rising through your form from the toes up until the body is consumed to ashes, then dissolved in the wind."

Practice: Similar to #19, but with specific focus on the fire rising through the central channel (sushumna). When body is burned, remain as the witness of the empty sky.

### Technique 26: World as Illusion
"When you see all this world as illusion, ineffable joy arises."

Practice: Simply see all phenomena - objects, people, events - as insubstantial as a dream. Not denying their relative existence, but recognizing their empty nature. Liberation is in this seeing.

### Technique 27: Neither in nor Out
"Neither concentrating on inner nor outer, but resting between - thus realize."

Practice: Don't focus on internal experiences (thoughts, sensations) or external objects. Rest attention in the gap between - neither absorbed in world nor in mind. This middle point is presence.

### Technique 28: Sky Gazing
"Look lovingly at some object. Do not go to another object. Here in the middle of the object - the blessing."

Practice: Gaze at an object (sky, candle, flower) with relaxed, soft focus. Don't analyze or think about it. Let awareness sink into the object until subject-object boundary dissolves.

### Technique 29: Endless Sky
"In summer, when you see the entire sky endlessly clear, enter such clarity."

Practice: On a clear day, gaze at the vast blue sky. Let the mind expand with the sky's endlessness. No edges, no boundaries - let consciousness dissolve into that infinite expanse.

### Technique 30: Total Darkness
"Closing both eyes, see within the dark void. There, the nature of the Divine."

Practice: Close eyes and enter the darkness within. Don't look for light or visions - dive into the pure darkness itself. This darkness is the womb of all manifestation.

### Technique 31: Darkness in Darkness
"At night in the dark fortnight, in utter darkness, with eyes closed, experience eternal dissolution."

Practice: During new moon, in complete external darkness, close eyes and merge with the absolute darkness. Inner and outer darkness unite - separation dissolves.

### Technique 32: Gazing at a Shadow
"Having blocked the eyes with both hands, perceiving forms in the forehead space, enter these forms and dissolve."

Practice: Cover closed eyes with palms. In the darkness, subtle colors and shapes may appear. Enter into these forms rather than observing them. Let awareness merge with them until they dissolve.

### Technique 33: Objects at Night
"At the edge of vision, when you see one thing ending and another beginning - here attention finds the center."

Practice: In dim light, look at the boundary where one object meets another. In that edge - that meeting point - the mind finds rest. Boundaries reveal the continuous nature of awareness.

### Technique 34: Seeing Only Light
"See as if for the first time a beauteous person or an ordinary object."

Practice: Look at anything - person, tree, stone - as if seeing it for the very first time, with fresh, innocent perception. Drop all concepts and memories. In that freshness is wonder, and in wonder, presence.

### Technique 35: The Interval Between Thoughts
"Wherever your attention alights, at this very point, experience."

Practice: Simply be present wherever attention naturally goes. Don't control attention - follow it. At the moment it rests anywhere, be totally there. The present moment is always the doorway.

### Technique 36: At Night
"At the point of sleep when sleep has not yet come and external wakefulness vanishes, at this point being is revealed."

Practice: When lying down to sleep, watch the transition from waking to sleeping. There is a moment when the outer world has faded but sleep hasn't arrived - rest there.

### Technique 37: Moonlight
"Let attention rest in the space between the eyebrows. Let mind be before thought. Let form fill with breath-essence to the top of the head, and there shower as light."

Practice: Focus between eyebrows (ajna chakra). Visualize light rising through the crown and showering down as moonlight or nectar, filling the entire body.

### Technique 38: Piercing Sound
"In rain during a dark night, enter that soundness which is the sound."

Practice: Listen to rain. Don't listen to individual drops but to the total sound-field. Let consciousness merge with that encompassing sound until you are the sound itself.

### Technique 39: After Desire
"Intently dwell on the reality between the two breaths, or after desire has been satisfied, dwell on the peace."

Practice: After any desire is fulfilled - after eating when satisfied, after achieving a goal - rest in the peace that naturally arises. Don't seek the next desire; rest in fulfillment.

### Technique 40: Meditate on Memory
"Recall some experience which occurred long ago; let other experiences drop. Think of nothing else. Thus the essence."

Practice: Remember a past experience vividly. Drop the narrative and hold only the feeling, the essence. Past becomes present - time collapses. What witnesses this memory?

### Technique 41: Withdrawing Desire
"Looking at some object, slowly withdraw your sight from it, then slowly withdraw your thought from it. Then."

Practice: Look at an object, then close eyes and hold the mental image. Now let even the mental image dissolve. What remains when the object, sight, and thought have all been withdrawn?

### Technique 42: When Desire Arises
"When a moody desire arises, do not place attention on it. Place attention on self, the desirer. Then."

Practice: When craving or desire appears, don't focus on the desired object. Turn attention around to the one who desires. Who is this desirer? In that inquiry, desire dissolves.

### Technique 43: Satisfaction Without Object
"Satisfaction exists without object. Rest in the pleasure of simply being."

Practice: Notice that basic contentment doesn't require any object. Before adding or acquiring anything, there is already the simple satisfaction of existing. Rest there.

### Technique 44: The Eternal
"Dwell on the reality which exists between pain and pleasure."

Practice: In pleasure, there is anticipation of its loss. In pain, there is hope for its end. Between them is something unchanging - presence itself. That is the eternal.

---

## Consciousness Techniques (45-77)

### Technique 45: Subject-Object Unity
"Objects and desires exist in me as in others. Accepting this, let them be translated."

Practice: Recognize that objects appearing in your experience also appear in others' experience. The same consciousness manifests through all. In this recognition, separation dissolves.

### Technique 46: Freedom from Knowledge
"Be free of all knowledge, neither knowing nor not knowing. For an instant only."

Practice: Release all knowing. Not into ignorance, but into pure awareness before knowledge. Even for a single instant of this unknowing knowing - liberation.

### Technique 47: Consciousness is Everywhere
"Suppose you contemplate something beyond perception, beyond grasping, beyond not being - you."

Practice: Consider what is beyond all perception, all concepts, all negations. Not nothing, not something. This inconceivable is your own nature.

### Technique 48: Devotion to the Guru
"In devotion and surrender, see the guru as pure presence. The guru's presence is your own presence."

Practice: Gaze at the form of the guru (physical or visualized) with total devotion. Let the form dissolve into light, light into presence. That presence is not separate from you.

### Technique 49: The Body as Empty
"Feel your substance - bones, flesh, blood - saturated with cosmic essence. At the boundaries, feel the universe."

Practice: Sense into the body's substance. Feel it not as solid but as vibrating energy. At the skin's boundary, feel no separation between body-energy and cosmic energy.

### Technique 50: Empty Body
"Feel the fine qualities of creativity permeating your breasts and assuming delicate configurations."

Practice: Whether male or female, sense the creative energy (Shakti) at the heart/chest center. Feel it as delicate, refined, all-pervasive.

### Technique 51: Mind in Body
"With intangible breath in center of forehead, as this reaches the heart at the moment of sleep, have direction over dreams and over death itself."

Practice: Before sleep, focus on the breath-energy moving from third eye to heart. Maintain awareness as you fall asleep. This practice eventually gives mastery over dream and death states.

### Technique 52: External and Internal
"Consider the external world as one with your inner world; everything - including your inner states - as the same divine play."

Practice: See outer objects and inner thoughts as the same substance displaying itself. No real boundary between inner and outer - one consciousness appearing as both.

### Technique 53: Space Within, Space Without
"Just as you have the impulse to do something, stop."

Practice: In the moment of intending an action - before the action - stop. In that gap between impulse and action, awareness of the witnessing self arises.

### Technique 54: Stop Before Action
"Without support of feet or hands, sit only on buttocks. Suddenly, the centering."

Practice: Sit with only the base of the body touching the ground. Feel unsupported, ungrounded. In this slight instability, awareness naturally centers itself.

### Technique 55: Swinging
"In an easy position, slowly pervade an area between the armpits into great peace."

Practice: Sit comfortably and spread awareness through the chest region between the armpits. This heart-space naturally invokes peace. Rest awareness there.

### Technique 56: Gaze
"See some region in your present form and pervade that region with your gracious presence until..."

Practice: Choose any body part - hand, foot, belly. Fill it completely with aware presence. When one part is suffused, let presence spread until the whole body is permeated.

### Technique 57: Piercing
"Feel your form as space, everywhere permeated by limitless space."

Practice: Feel the body as not solid but as space. Like the space in a pot is not separate from space outside, body-space is cosmic space. Boundaries are imagined.

### Technique 58: Any Point in the Body
"Any spot in your body, consider it as nothing, and in a few breaths, become null."

Practice: Focus on any body point - fingertip, navel, crown. Consider that spot as empty, void. As that spot dissolves, let nullity spread until the whole body-sense vanishes.

### Technique 59: Consider Space as Your Body
"Consider that your body has void and you are void. This void is your nature. Through practice it becomes clear."

Practice: Contemplate the body as already empty, void. You are that emptiness itself. The appearance of body arises within your void nature. Rest as the void.

### Technique 60: Attribute-less Awareness
"Look upon a bowl without seeing the sides or the material. In a few moments become aware."

Practice: Look at any container. See the space it holds, not the container itself. Pure space-awareness - formless, unlimited. Now, realize that awareness is space-like.

### Technique 61: Consciousness Contains All
"Abide in some place endlessly spacious, clear of trees, hills, habitations. Thence comes the end of mind pressures."

Practice: Go to or visualize a vast open space - desert, ocean, sky. Let the mind expand with that vastness. External spaciousness reveals internal spaciousness.

### Technique 62: Space Pervades
"Consider the plenum to be your own body of bliss."

Practice: Feel fullness everywhere - not empty void but pregnant fullness. This fullness is your bliss-body. Everything is full of presence.

### Technique 63: While Being Caressed
"While being caressed, Sweet Princess, enter the caress as everlasting life."

Practice: During any pleasant touch, don't focus on the touching body parts or the pleasure itself. Enter the essence of the experience - the aliveness itself. That is eternal.

### Technique 64: Eating and Drinking
"When eating or drinking, become the taste of the food or drink, and be filled."

Practice: When eating, become taste itself. Not "I am tasting" but "I am taste." Fill consciousness with the pure experience of flavor. The experiencer merges with experience.

### Technique 65: Music
"O lotus-eyed one, sweet of touch, when singing, seeing, tasting, be aware you are and discover the ever-living."

Practice: During any sensory enjoyment - music, beauty, taste - remain aware of being. Experience plus being-awareness reveals the deathless.

### Technique 66: Wherever Satisfaction
"Wherever satisfaction is found, in whatever act, actualize this."

Practice: Note any moment of satisfaction, however small. In that instant, fully actualize - be completely present to - the satisfaction. It points to your nature as contentment itself.

### Technique 67: Sleep to Waking
"At the point of sleep when sleep has not yet come and wakefulness not yet gone, in that gap, be aware."

Practice: Same as #36. The transition point between waking and sleeping is a powerful doorway. Rest awareness there without falling into sleep or back to waking.

### Technique 68: Letter A
"In summer when you see the entire sky endlessly clear - enter such clarity."

Practice: Same as #29. Use the clear summer sky as a support for experiencing clarity - not just visual clarity but clarity of awareness itself.

### Technique 69: Looking
"Shakti, see all space as if already absorbed in your own head in the brilliance."

Practice: Feel all space - the room, the world, the cosmos - condensed into the brilliance of awareness within your head. Space folds into the light of consciousness.

### Technique 70: Waking After Deep Sleep
"On waking, prolong the moment of knowing."

Practice: In the instant of waking, before thoughts about the day begin, there is pure knowing. Prolong this state. Don't immediately think; just be knowing itself.

### Technique 71: Fire of Dissolution
"In anger, or in joy, enter the flame and dissolve."

Practice: Strong emotions are fire. Instead of expressing outward or suppressing, enter directly into the fire of the emotion. Let it burn the one who feels it. What remains?

### Technique 72: Creative Confusion
"Make the mind blank by rejecting all previous experiences. At such a moment, enlightenment may dawn."

Practice: Empty the mind completely of all memory, all knowledge, all identity. In that creative void, realization can spontaneously arise.

### Technique 73: Gazing Without Blinking
"Without blinking, without closing eyes, look at some spot. With closed eyes, visualize it. Open eyes, see again. Thus the truth."

Practice: Gaze steadily at an object without blinking. Close eyes and hold the after-image. Open and compare. The persistence of image reveals the mind's creative power.

### Technique 74: Awareness Without Object
"Devi, imagine Sanskrit letters in these honey-filled foci of awareness, first as letters, then more subtly as sounds, then as most subtle feeling. Then, leaving them aside, be free."

Practice: Visualize sacred letters at chakra points. Let letters dissolve to pure sound, sound to vibration, vibration to subtle feeling. Then let even feeling dissolve. Freedom remains.

### Technique 75: At Any Moment
"Feel the fine qualities of creativity permeating your breasts and assuming delicate configurations."

(See also #50) This technique emphasizes the subtle creative energy felt in the heart region - available to all genders as the seat of divine creativity.

### Technique 76: All Acts as One
"See all activities, from the whole flow of life, as the same vibrating consciousness."

Practice: Whether eating, walking, talking, or sitting - see all activities as modifications of one consciousness. One awareness acting in countless ways. You are that awareness.

### Technique 77: Whatever
"At whatever moment, by whatever name, and in whatever form - here is the One."

Practice: Any moment, any name (mantra, thought), any form (object, vision) - recognize these as the One appearing. Nothing exists outside the One. You are that One.

---

## Techniques of Emotion & Negation (78-112)

### Technique 78: Self-Inquiry
"This so-called universe appears as a juggling, a picture show. To be happy, look upon it so."

Practice: See the world as a divine play, a movie projected by consciousness. Taking it as ultimate reality causes suffering. Seeing its play-nature brings joy.

### Technique 79: Stop Defining
"O Beloved, put attention neither on pleasure nor on pain but between these."

Practice: Same as #44. The space between pleasure and pain is equanimity - your natural state undisturbed by opposites.

### Technique 80: Giving Up Attachment
"Cast away attachment to body, and with firm knowing be the Knowing One."

Practice: Let go of identification with the body. Know yourself as the knower - that which is aware of body, not contained by body. The Knowing One is unborn, undying.

### Technique 81: Nothing to Possess
"Where thoughts do not pervade, stay firm."

Practice: There are gaps between thoughts, moments of no-mind. Rest firmly in those gaps. Don't invite the next thought. The gap is your natural state.

### Technique 82: I Am
"Grasp the fact: 'I am' - this is sufficient. Be absorbed in that."

Practice: Simply affirm and feel "I am" - not "I am this" or "I am that." Pure being. Hold this sense of existence. It is the root of all, prior to all else.

### Technique 83: No Division
"Toss attachment for body aside. Realize I am everywhere. One who is everywhere is joyous."

Practice: Release body-identification. Feel presence extending in all directions. The body is in you; you are not in the body. Omnipresence is bliss.

### Technique 84: Subject and Object as One
"Thinking no thing, will limited-self unlimit."

Practice: Think of absolutely nothing. In that absence of thought, the limited self expands into unlimited awareness. Thought creates limitation; no-thought reveals infinity.

### Technique 85: Dissolution of Thought
"Believe omniscient, omnipotent, pervading."

Practice: Affirm and feel: I am all-knowing, all-powerful, all-pervading. Not as ego-inflation but as recognition of your true nature as consciousness itself.

### Technique 86: Meditation on Elements
"Each thing is perceived through knowing. The self shines in space through knowing. Perceive one being as knower and known."

Practice: Both the perceived object and the perceiving subject arise within knowing. Know knower and known as one reality - awareness itself.

### Technique 87: Without the Body
"Mind, the inner self, intuition - know these as one. The universe becomes one."

Practice: Mind (manas), individual soul (jivatma), and pure intuition (buddhi) are not separate. They are facets of one consciousness. See them as one and multiplicity dissolves.

### Technique 88: Who Am I?
"Before desire and before knowing, how can I say I am? Consider. Dissolve in the beauty."

Practice: Before wanting anything, before knowing anything - what are you? Prior to desire and knowledge, only pure existence remains. Rest in that prior-ness.

### Technique 89: Illusion
"Devi, dream, illusion, imagined castle in the air - contemplate these and recognize their illusory nature."

Practice: See dreams, fantasies, and mental projections as empty. Then see waking life with the same insight. All appearances are like dreams - vivid but insubstantial.

### Technique 90: Self-Existing Awareness
"Since knowledge, desire, appearance as illusion has no reality, focus awareness on the one who knows, desires, perceives."

Practice: Don't focus on what you know, want, or see. Focus on who knows, wants, sees. Turn attention to the subject. The subject is consciousness itself.

### Technique 91: Illusion Cannot Touch
"Illusion deceives. Colors circumscribe. Even divisibles are indivisible."

Practice: Recognize that all apparent divisions, all separate colors and forms, exist within one indivisible awareness. Division is appearance; unity is reality.

### Technique 92: Absolute Freedom
"In any easy position, without any support, remain."

Practice: Sit without leaning on anything - no backrest, no support. This physical independence mirrors the awareness that depends on nothing for its existence.

### Technique 93: Gazing at a Wall
"Seated, in an easy position, fixing the buttocks as support, remain without support in the mind."

Practice: While body is supported, let mind be unsupported - not resting on any thought, memory, or sensation. Mind floating in its own space.

### Technique 94: Rocking
"In a moving vehicle, by rhythmically swaying, experience. Or in a still vehicle, by letting yourself swing in slowing invisible circles."

Practice: During travel or by gentle self-rocking, let the rhythmic motion dissolve fixation. Awareness becomes fluid, released from rigid attention.

### Technique 95: Piercing
"Pierce some part of your nectar-filled form with a pin, and gently enter the piercing."

Practice: (Use very light pressure) Bring attention to a body point with slight pressure. Enter that point completely with awareness. The focus reveals the presence pervading that point.

### Technique 96: Thought-Free
"As thought arrives, perceive it at its origin. At this the thinking dissolves."

Practice: When a thought arises, immediately look for its source - where did it come from? In that looking, the thought dissolves. The source is always silent awareness.

### Technique 97: Sound
"Intone a sound. At its origin, remain in the nature."

Practice: Make any sound and be present to its very beginning. Stay at that origin point. The source of sound is silence. Remain as that silence.

### Technique 98: Before Sleep
"In sleep, when sleep has not yet come and is not yet gone - at this point, be aware."

Practice: Again the threshold between waking and sleep. This in-between state, caught with awareness, reveals the continuous consciousness underlying all states.

### Technique 99: Gazing at Light
"Gaze, without moving an eyelash, at a spot. With awareness, meet inner luminosity."

Practice: Gaze steadily at any point. Without blinking, hold the gaze. Inner light will become apparent - not external light but the luminosity of awareness itself.

### Technique 100: Centering
"When some desire comes, consider it. Then, suddenly, quit it."

Practice: When desire arises, pause and observe it fully. Then abruptly abandon it. In that sudden stopping, consciousness snaps to center.

### Technique 101: Self-Containment
"Suppose you do not know anything. Let go of all knowledge and become innocent."

Practice: Drop everything you know. Return to the state of not-knowing like an infant. Fresh, innocent, empty. In this emptiness, true wisdom can arise.

### Technique 102: Reality is One
"That which contains all this world in itself - meditate on that as containing you. Or on infinite space. Or on clear sky."

Practice: Contemplate the container of all - that in which galaxies and atoms appear. That container contains you. You are in it; it is your nature.

### Technique 103: The Fourth State
"Dwell on the idea: In all three states - waking, dreaming, deep sleep - consciousness remains the same."

Practice: In waking, dreaming, and deep sleep, something knows. That knowing is the same in all states. It doesn't sleep when you sleep. Identify as That.

### Technique 104: Stop in the Middle
"In moods of extreme desire, be undisturbed."

Practice: When overwhelmed by desire, don't act or suppress. Simply be still within the storm. The undisturbed center reveals itself.

### Technique 105: Satchidananda
"Experience 'I am being, consciousness, bliss.'"

Practice: Sat-Chit-Ananda: Existence, Consciousness, Bliss. Feel these as your nature, not as something to attain. You ARE being-awareness-joy.

### Technique 106: Object Becoming Subject
"Toss attachment for body aside. This world is the body of the Lord."

Practice: Release identification with the individual body. See the entire world as the divine body. You are consciousness wearing the world as body.

### Technique 107: Feel Your Presence
"Feel: My thought, I-ness, internal organs - me."

Practice: Notice: thoughts arise in you, "I"-sense arises in you, body organs are perceived by you. All of "me" appears within awareness. You are that awareness.

### Technique 108: Beyond Mind
"Go beyond the experience of all knowledge."

Practice: Knowledge is limitation. Go beyond all knowing to pure unknowing awareness. Before knowledge, prior to experience - what is there?

### Technique 109: No Experience
"Enter space, supportless, eternal, still."

Practice: Contemplate infinite space - self-existing, needing no support, timeless, unmoving. Enter into identity with that space. You are that.

### Technique 110: Empty Mind
"The appreciation of objects and subjects is the same for an enlightened as for an unenlightened person. The former has one greatness: he remains in the subjective mood, not lost in things."

Practice: Continue perceiving normally, but always remain as the perceiver. Don't get lost in objects. Stay home as the subject while the world plays.

### Technique 111: Knowledge and Knowable as One
"I am not only existent - I am existence itself."

Practice: Move from "I exist" (implying I could not-exist) to "I AM existence." There is no separate I that exists. You are existence-itself appearing as apparent individuality.

### Technique 112: Totality
"Each feeling, mood, or experience is an expression of the All. Simply experience it completely and be free."

Practice: Whatever arises - pleasant or unpleasant - is the Divine expressing itself. Don't reject anything. Full acceptance of what is, as it is, is liberation.
